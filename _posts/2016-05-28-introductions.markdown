This site is intended to showcase various projects which I have participated in or created on my own.  Some of these will be works in progress, but should serve to showcase my style and abilities along with demonstrating approaches to common problems faced in software development.

My experience began in middle school, with GW Basic and basic input/output and lead to attending UT Dallas with the intent to complete a degree in Computer Science.  During this time I studied C++, assembly, and many other technologies.  While I did not graduate, I left on good terms with the intent to complete my education when possible.

Following college, I continued to grow learning Visual Basic and doing work in VBA automation, Access front end development, SQL server, and other technologies, ultimately being responsible for the server room upgrade of a small office (50 workstations).  

Most recently, I have moved into the open source realm, working in Linux web hosting offering support on common Website and web server issues.  I have developed a healthy passion for the Python programming language, and it is largely the focus of my recent efforts.  I have designed Gtk windowed applications, Django websites, terminal applications using websockets, daemons, and many other utilities all through the magic of Python.

In my primary employment, I work on CentOS servers, using Bash extensively and offering support on e-mail, FTP, SSH, MySQL, cPanel, WHM, and other common hosting technologies.  This has caused a regrowth in my love of Bash, which I initially learned in college.
